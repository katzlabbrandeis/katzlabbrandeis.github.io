# üß† Welcome to the Katz Lab

## Decoding Neural Ensemble Dynamics in Real-Time

The Katz Lab at Brandeis University is at the forefront of understanding how our brains process sensory information and control movement. Using cutting-edge techniques, we investigate neural ensemble dynamics in awake rodents to unlock the mysteries of sensori-motor processes.

### üî¨ Our Research Approach

We combine multiple innovative methodologies:
- Behavioral analysis
- Multi-neuronal electrophysiology
- Complex data analysis and modeling
- Pharmacological interventions
- Optogenetic techniques

### üéØ What Makes Us Unique

Our lab specializes in real-time analysis of ongoing neural activity, providing unprecedented insights into how the brain processes information and controls behavior in living organisms.
