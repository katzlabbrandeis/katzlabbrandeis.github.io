## Introduction

I've been manually tweaking cluster parameters for years, and I'm thrilled to report that those days might finally be behind us. PR #26 "auto clustering" just landed in the blech_clust repo, and it's completely transformed how I approach post-processing. The secret sauce? Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models that adapt to your data in ways regular GMMs just can't match.

## Key Technical Aspects

This update is centered around the integration of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMMs) into the blech_process script, as an alternative to regular Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). BGMMs are a powerful tool for data clustering and this integration adds a new level of sophistication to our auto-sorting capabilities.

Here's a snapshot of the new additions to the `blech_run_auto_process.py` file:

```python
+from sklearn.mixture import BayesianGaussianMixture as BGM
...
+"""
+Script to automatically post-process blech data.
+
+Autoclustering will be done using Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMMs)
+from scikit-learn.
+"""
```

The changes also include minor bug fixes and improvements to enhance the overall performance. For example, the numbering of clusters for BGM has been fixed and the selection of arbitrary cluster numbers has been allowed.

## Impact and Benefits

Incorporating BGMMs into the auto-sorting step provides several advantages over regular GMMs. BGMMs are more flexible, allowing for a better fit to the data and ultimately leading to more accurate clustering results. This accuracy will significantly enhance our data post-processing capabilities, ultimately improving the quality of our research outputs.

In addition, the selection of arbitrary cluster numbers promotes flexibility in our data analysis. This can be particularly useful when we want to experiment with different numbers of clusters to see how it affects our results.

Moreover, the bug fixes enhance the stability of our system, ensuring a smoother user experience.

## Conclusion

The "26 auto clustering" PR is a significant step forward for our blech_clust repository. The introduction of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility to select arbitrary cluster numbers have greatly enhanced our auto-sorting capabilities. This update, along with the bug fixes, opens up new possibilities for our data post-processing and analysis. We look forward to seeing the impact of these changes on our future work.
