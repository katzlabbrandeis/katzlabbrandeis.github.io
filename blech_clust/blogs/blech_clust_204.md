# No More Pipeline Chaos: Smart Dependency Management Arrives

We've all been there - you kick off a pipeline run, walk away for coffee, and come back to find it crashed because step 3 ran before step 2 was ready. Frustrating, right? That's why I'm so excited about the update that landed in `Blech_clust` on August 15th.

PR #204 introduces something I've wanted for ages: smart dependency checking that prevents pipeline steps from running until their prerequisites are complete. It's like having a traffic controller for your data processing that ensures everything happens in the right order.

## Delving into the Technical Details

The pull request introduced changes across a total of 21 files with 413 additions and 28 deletions. The main languages involved in these changes were Python and JSON. The key files affected were `blech_clust.py`, `blech_common_avg_reference.py`, `blech_exp_info.py`, `blech_make_arrays.py`, and `blech_make_psth.py`.

In each of these files, a new function `pipeline_graph_check()` was added. This function, which resides in `utils.blech_utils`, checks if the dependencies for the current script have been successfully executed before allowing it to run. If the check passes, the function then logs the attempt and completion status of the script.

An example of how this function is used can be seen in `blech_clust.py`:

```diff

+this_pipeline_check = pipeline_graph_check(dir_name)
+this_pipeline_check.check_previous(script_path)
+this_pipeline_check.write_to_log(script_path, 'attempted')
+
 print(f'Processing : {dir_name}')
 os.chdir(dir_name)
```

## The Impact of These Changes

This update brings several notable benefits to the Blech_clust pipeline. The primary benefit is the enhancement of the pipeline's robustness. By ensuring that each step is only executed once its dependencies have been fulfilled, the likelihood of errors occurring due to an inconsistent execution order is drastically reduced.

Furthermore, by logging the attempt and completion status of each script, the update makes the pipeline's execution process more transparent. This transparency is especially beneficial for debugging, as it allows users to quickly identify which steps of the pipeline have been executed and which have not.

## Conclusion

The enhancements introduced by pull request #204 significantly improve the workflow management system of the Blech_clust pipeline. These changes not only make the pipeline more robust and efficient but also improve its transparency, making it easier for users to track the execution process. This update is a testament to the continuous effort put into improving the Blech_clust pipeline, and we look forward to seeing more updates in the future that make electrophysiology data analysis even more efficient and reliable.
