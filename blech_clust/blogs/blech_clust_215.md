## Introduction
In an effort to enhance the functionality and usability of the Blech Clust project, a significant code change has been implemented. The change, introduced in a pull request titled "Add ephys_data as a utility," aims to incorporate usage instructions for electrophysiology (ephys) data into the project's roadmap. 

## Key Aspects of the Changes
The pull request involves the addition of a new module, ephys_data, which is now added as a utility in the Blech Clust project. This module has been incorporated into several key files, including BAKS.py, region_spectrogram_plot.py, and ephys_data.py, among others. 

The changes include the addition of 1939 lines of code across 11 files, with no deletions. Notably, Python (py) and log are the primary languages used in these changes.

Here's a snippet of the changes made to the BAKS.py file:

## The Impact of These Changes
The addition of the ephys_data utility significantly improves the functionality and usability of the Blech Clust project. With the new utility, users can now access and utilize ephys data more efficiently, thereby accelerating their research processes.

The addition of usage instructions for ephys data in the roadmap also enhances the projectâ€™s documentation. This will be particularly beneficial for new users or users unfamiliar with electrophysiology data, as it provides a clear guide on how to use the newly added utility.

## Conclusion
The inclusion of the ephys_data utility in the Blech Clust project marks a significant improvement in the project's capabilities. It not only expands the project's functionality but also improves its usability, making it a more versatile tool for researchers in the field of electrophysiology. The contributions made by abuzarmahmood and Abuzar Mahmood are truly instrumental in enhancing the project and will undoubtedly benefit its users.
