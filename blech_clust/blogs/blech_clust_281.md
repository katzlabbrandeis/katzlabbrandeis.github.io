## Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of data science, detecting drifts in data is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models. In this blog post, we're diving into some recent enhancements to PCA drift detection using changepoint. These changes were first introduced in a pull request by contributors Abuzar Mahmood and abuzarmahmood, with the goal of improving the efficiency and reliability of drift detection mechanisms.

## Key Technical Aspects

The changes introduced in the pull request have been centered around three main areas: 

1. **Addition of pymc to install requirements:** The Python package `pymc`, a probabilistic programming framework, was added to the installation requirements. This package provides a robust set of tools for Bayesian statistical modeling and probabilistic machine learning.

2. **Implementation of population drift detection using ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound):** ELBO is a fundamental concept in variational inference that helps in the approximation of complex probability distributions. This addition to the code will make the drift detection process more accurate.

3. **Code Cleanup:** To improve readability and maintainability of the code, some cleanup was performed.

The core of the changes can be seen in this code snippet from the pull request:

This shows the addition of the `pymc` package to the requirements file, which is essential for the new drift detection mechanism.

## Impact and Benefits

The changes introduced in this pull request have a significant impact on the performance and effectiveness of the PCA drift detection:

1. **Improved Accuracy:** By using ELBO for drift detection, we can achieve a more accurate representation of our data, leading to more precise drift detection.

2. **Enhanced Performance:** With the inclusion of pymc and fastcluster in the requirements, the performance of the overall drift detection process is enhanced.

3. **Code Maintainability:** The cleanup in the code makes it easier to read and maintain, facilitating future enhancements and bug fixes.

## Conclusion

This pull request is an excellent example of how small changes can have a substantial effect on the functionality and performance of a software solution. With these enhancements, the PCA drift detection using changepoint is now more accurate and efficient. It's a testament to the continuous efforts by the contributors to improve the system's quality, making it more reliable for users. As the field of data science continues to evolve, we can expect even more improvements and innovations in the future.
