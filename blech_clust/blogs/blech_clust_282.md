## Introduction

I've spent countless hours manually creating test datasets for our ML pipelines, and I bet you have too. It's tedious, error-prone work that nobody enjoys. That's why I was thrilled to see Abuzar Mahmood's [PR #278](https://github.com/katzlabbrandeis/blech_clust/pull/282) land in the `blech_clust` repo last week.

The big win? We can now run `blech_exp_info` programmatically with command line arguments. This might sound small, but it's a massive time-saver that completely transforms how we create and manage test datasets.

## Key Technical Aspects

The essential changes in PR #278 revolve around the creation of the `DigInHandler` and its integration into the `blech_exp_info.py` script. This handler records relevant information, including pulse starts and ends, and writes them to the `dig_in_frame.csv` file. This file is then used in `blech_clust.py` and `blech_make_arrays.py`, minimizing the need for reloading dig-ins.

The `DigInHandler` also standardizes the numbering of dig-ins across file types, reducing potential confusion. Here is an example of the code changes in `blech_clust.py`:

## Impact and Benefits

The changes in PR #278 bring significant benefits, especially for users working with large datasets. By allowing `blech_exp_info` to be run programmatically, users can automate the creation of test datasets, saving valuable time and reducing the risk of error.

The introduction of `DigInHandler` simplifies the handling of digital inputs, again saving time and reducing complexity for the user. By recording relevant information upfront, the need for continuous reloading of dig-ins is eliminated.

The consolidation of dig-in numbering across file types is another key improvement, reducing potential confusion and making the code easier to read and understand.

## Conclusion

The changes made in PR #278 of the `blech_clust` repository showcase good software engineering practice, where efficiency, user-friendliness, and readability are key. By enabling programmatic running of `blech_exp_info`, the creation of test datasets is now more efficient. The introduction of `DigInHandler` and the consolidation of dig-in numbering across file types further simplify the user experience. This is a clear demonstration of how thoughtful code changes can have a significant impact on user experience and efficiency.
