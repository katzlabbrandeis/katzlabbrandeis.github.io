## Introduction

In the fast-paced realm of software development, efficiently managing dependencies can make or break your workflow. If you've ever juggled packages between `pip` and `conda`, you know what I mean. On **September 26, 2025**, a game-changing pull request was merged into the `blech_clust` repository. This update aims to simplify our lives by using just `pip` for Python packages, making dependency management a walk in the park and smoothing out the installation process.

## Key Changes: A Closer Look

### Installation Consolidation

The standout change? We've merged `conda_requirements_base.txt` and `pip_requirements_base.txt` into a single `requirements/requirements.txt`. Now, all your Python dependencies are managed with `pip`. No more flipping back and forth between `conda` and `pip`—it's all in one place.

#### Code Example

```diff
-Makefile
-.PHONY: all base emg neurec blechrnn clean params patch
+.PHONY: all base emg neurec blechrnn clean params dev optional prefect update make_env

-# Store sudo password
-# define get_sudo_password
-# $(eval SUDO_PASS := $(shell bash -c 'read -s -p "Enter sudo password: " pwd; echo $$pwd'))
-# @echo
-# endef
+# Consolidated pip-based installation - no sudo required for base packages
```

### Package Cleanup

We also took a fine-tooth comb to the codebase, saying goodbye to some freeloaders like `bokeh`, `dask`, and `fastcluster`—packages that weren't pulling their weight. This cleanup speeds up installation and saves disk space, and you'll face fewer package conflicts to boot.

### Documentation Updates

To help you navigate these changes, we've added a new file, `INSTALLATION_MIGRATION.md`. This handy guide walks you through the migration process and spells out the perks of our new installation approach.

## Impact and Benefits

### Simplified Dependency Management

With everything now under `pip`, setting up your environment just got a whole lot easier. No more version conflicts from mixing package managers—it's a more predictable and straightforward setup.

### Faster and Cleaner Environment Setup

By stripping out the unnecessary and streamlining the process, setup is quicker and less cluttered. That means fewer headaches during installation and more time to focus on what really matters: the code.

### Enhanced Reproducibility

A consistent installation process across platforms is a dream come true for collaborative and open-source projects. For something like `blech_clust`, which needs precise environmental conditions, this is a big win.

## Challenges and Decisions

Switching to a `pip`-only installation came with its own set of hurdles, particularly ensuring existing workflows remained intact. We opted to keep the `Makefile` commands unchanged, preventing any nasty surprises for our users. It’s all about balancing innovation with stability, right?

## Broader Project Context

`blech_clust`, a project knee-deep in data processing and machine learning, stands to gain a lot from a stable and efficient setup. This consolidation is a leap towards modernizing the project’s infrastructure, making it more welcoming for newcomers and easier to maintain.

## Conclusion and Future Directions

This pull request is a big step forward in managing dependencies within `blech_clust`. By streamlining the installation process, we've not only boosted performance and reliability but also laid the groundwork for future improvements. Looking ahead, we might focus on further optimizing workflows, possibly incorporating more automated testing and deployment strategies.

In a nutshell, these changes tackle the common headaches in software development head-on. By keeping things simple and efficient, `blech_clust` is poised for ongoing growth and success.
